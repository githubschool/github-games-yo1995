Buttigieg is an outspoken supporter of DACA and easing deportation policies. 

He opposes aggressive deportation policies and believes Congress should pass a law creating a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants who entered the country illegally as children. His stance suggests a comprehensive immigration reform, but as of May 2019, nothing from his campaign has outlined substantial policy measures that would accomplish this goal. 

He does state that American immigration laws need to reflect humanitarian and economic needs as the nation “needs to reestablish its global leadership in humanitarian relief for refugees”. 

He wants to end family separation and examine ICE practices to prevent arbitrary targeting of im/migrant communities by law enforcement.
