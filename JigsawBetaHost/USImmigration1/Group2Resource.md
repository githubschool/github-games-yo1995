The most prominent aspect of Castro’s campaign is his stance on Immigration. 22-25% of his campaign messaging is focused on Immigration and Criminal Justice issues facing migrants. He has already unveiled his immigration platform: his People First Immigration Policy, which reverses Trump’s travel ban and provides a pathway to citizenship for people in the country unlawfully. The policy also calls to decriminalize illegal border crossing and repealing the law that makes it a criminal offense to enter the U.S. illegally.
He also wants to “reconstitute” I.C.E. and reunite families.
